This project uses interfaces available on a PC to communicate between two computers it is written in .net C#. It simulates serial transmission compliant with the RS232 standard. In the transmitter, the text to be sent is prepared as a sequence of ASCII characters. Then, this text is formatted to the bitstream format by adding a start bit, an LSB-to-MSB byte, and two stop bits, and is saved into a chain. The chain is then displayed in a separate field on the screen. Communication simulation, as described above, is allowed between two applications
